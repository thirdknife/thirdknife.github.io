title: NASA Space Apps Challange Islamabad 2014
---

This blog post the experience I got from organizing NASA Space Apps Challange 2014 Islamabad edition.

-----

I have had interest in Space Sciences since 2009 when first my college teacher told me about meteor shower. I was up all night that night and I was hooked to it after then. I am a computer science graduate and I wanted to mashup both sciences so that I can work on my passion.

I applied to host Space Apps 2014 in November 2013, and got a go ahead in January. I started planning for the event and organinzing the team. I contacted my university from where I graduated that I wanted to organise the event, which I was granted. 

We got GitHub as the event Sponsor. They sent us Stickers with rocket printed on it. We custom printed 50 T-shirts do distribute among the attendees. Finally the date came and the event started and attendees reached the venue.

6 teams were formed and 6 problems were solved during the 48 hours Space Hacking. Final judging were done by Dr. Waqas Qazi, he works at Islamabad Space Institute.

LeapBot was the solution that was nominated for Global Awards Finalist. You can see the decleration [here](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/awards/#globalawards).
