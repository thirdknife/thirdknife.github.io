title: Lingo Game in Javascript
---

This blog post is about an opensource Lingo game.

-----

One of the vivid memories from my childhood was growing up watching the TV game by the name of Lingo (a.k.a Bingo). I liked the game show because it was a test of not only intellegence but also mindfulness. Even today if I watch that show it takes me back to those days and I can recall all my memories.

I wanted to play that game online but didn't found one in JavaScript. So I created my own as one of my opensource projects. I invite the JavaScript community to contribute to my opensource game.

The development stack at the moment is very basic. Its just the [Express App](http://expressjs.com) with few jade templates. I will write a blog post about every new feature I add. Currently it only allows the user to type in 5 words and it will tell you what letters are correct and what are misplaced and what are not inculeded in the original word to guess.

Green : Letter is correct and in place

Red : Letter is not correct 

Blue : Letter is in the word but its in a different place

Current demo url is : http://frozen-harbor-1005.herokuapp.com/
