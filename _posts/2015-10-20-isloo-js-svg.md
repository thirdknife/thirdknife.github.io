title: Starting islooJS
---

We are starting islooJS, a meetup for Javascript enthusiasts based in Islamabad!

-----

Today I am with the efforts of [Sakina](https://twitter.com/Sakina308) and [Creanyx](https://twitter.com/creanyx) starting an Islamabad based meetup for JavaScript developers. The purpose is to bring the creative heads under one roof once a month to share ideas and help the JavaScript Community in general.

To start with I have created an animation for islooJS landing page using SVG and CSS.

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="rOyxea" data-default-tab="result" data-user="thirdknife" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/thirdknife/pen/rOyxea/'>islooJS (SVG)</a> by Shakeel Shafiq (<a href='http://codepen.io/thirdknife'>@thirdknife</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

This will be once in a month meetup and will be hosting at local cafe's in Islamabad. More details will be posted in the webist [islooJS](http://isloojs.com).
