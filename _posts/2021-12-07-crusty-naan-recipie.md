# Recipie
1. Prehead the oven to 400F.
2. Take what ever quantity of milk, this will make sure how much dough you want. I usually take 2 cups of milk and make it luke warm in the microwave.
3. Add 1 teaspoon of Yeast in the warm milk and let it sit for 5 mins. 
4. Add 1 teaspoon sugar and pinch of salt.
5. Start mixing flour, add to the amount where it is still like paste. Keep mixing with hand or a plastic stick. 
6. Start adding more flour until it start to get a doughy shape. Once you get the desired consistensy which is not too hard not to soft, start mixing it well.
7. Add 1 teaspoon of olive oil and keep mixing it until it turns into rounded shape dough.
8. Let the dough rise for 2 hours.
9. Make small equal dough balls and start making them flat. Use the tip of your fingers to make it flat and shape it how ever you want. 
10. Melt butter and use a brush to brush butter off on the top of dough. 
11. Sprinkle seesame seeds on top.
12. Put the dough in the oven and bake it for 5 mins or until it starts to turn brown. Switch to broil so that the top part can get crispy.
13. Serve it with curry or a dip of choice.
